###  This project based on Financial loan services are leveraged by companies across many industries, from big banks to financial institutions to government loans. One of the primary objectives of companies with financial loan services is to decrease payment defaults and ensure that individuals are paying back their loans as expected. In order to do this efficiently and systematically, many companies employ machine learning to predict which individuals are at the highest risk of defaulting on their loans, so that proper interventions can be effectively deployed to the right audience.
